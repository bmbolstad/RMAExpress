NEWS FILE FOR RMAEXPRESS


CHANGES IN 1.1.0
----------------


General:
- Unified source code between windows, liunx and mac osx builds. Previously mac osx source code changes were not merged into the main code base.
- Now building binaries against wxWidgets-3.0-rc1 for all platforms

RMADataConv:
- Remove strict checking of version number between pgf and clf files. It appears that there are a number of released pgf/clf file combinations that don't properly match (notably HuGene 2.0, MoGene 2.0).
